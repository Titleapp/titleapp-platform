# Personal Vault — Onboarding Rules
# Uses: raas/onboarding/personal-onboarding.md

The Personal Vault uses the personal onboarding sequence, NOT the business onboarding.

## Key Differences from Business:
- No business identity or verification
- No team setup
- No autonomy levels
- No bulk data imports
- One item at a time, user's pace
- AI organizes, reminds, and advises — never acts externally

## Vault-Specific Categories:
- Vehicles (titles, registrations, insurance, maintenance)
- Property (deeds, mortgages, leases, HOA)
- Important Documents (IDs, passports, wills, tax returns)
- Financial (accounts, statements, investments)
- Education (diplomas, transcripts, certifications)
- Medical (insurance cards, prescriptions, records)
- Other (anything the user wants to store)

## First Value Priorities:
1. Deadline/expiration detection — registrations, insurance, passports, leases
2. Market value estimates — vehicles, property
3. Coverage gap identification — insurance, warranty
4. Document organization — auto-categorize uploaded files

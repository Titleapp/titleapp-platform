# Personal Vault — Marketing Rules
# Extends: raas/marketing/README.md

## Vault-Specific Marketing

The Personal Vault does NOT have user-facing marketing features. Vault users don't run ad campaigns or manage marketing budgets.

However, the vault does participate in TitleApp's marketing ecosystem in two ways:

### 1. Cross-sell Opportunities
When a vault user adds an asset (vehicle, property), the AI may surface relevant service recommendations:
- "You added a 2022 RAV4. Want me to compare insurance rates?"
- "Your homeowner's insurance expires next month. Want me to help you shop rates?"

These are NOT ads. They are contextual suggestions from the AI based on the user's own data. They connect to TitleApp's service marketplace (future feature) or partner referral network.

### 2. TitleApp's Own Marketing (Dogfooding)
The vault is a customer acquisition channel for TitleApp's business verticals:
- Vault user who is also a business owner → "I see you're tracking 3 vehicles. Do you run a business? TitleApp has a workspace for auto dealers, insurance agents, and more."
- Vault user who mentions buying a house → "Need a title company or mortgage broker? TitleApp can connect you."

These cross-sells are governed by strict rules:
- Never pushy. Maximum once per month.
- Always relevant to what the user is actually doing.
- User can permanently dismiss: "Don't suggest business features."

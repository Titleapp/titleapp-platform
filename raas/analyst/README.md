# RAAS — Analyst (Vertical Baseline)

This directory defines the Rules as a Service (RAAS) baseline
for the Analyst vertical.

Purpose:
- deterministic deal screening
- evidence-first analysis
- tenant risk-profile enforcement
- standardized analyst outputs

This vertical is used as the primary testbed for RAAS expansion
into other verticals.

# Extends: raas/marketing/README.md

## Analyst-Specific Marketing

### Primary Channels (by priority):
1. **LinkedIn** — Thought leadership, LP outreach, professional network building. This is the #1 channel.
2. **Email** — Research distribution, market commentary, LP communications, deal announcements.
3. **Google Ads** — Selective use for fund marketing, conference promotion, talent acquisition.
4. **Industry events** — Conferences, panels, webinars. AI helps prepare materials and follow-up.
5. **Content/PR** — Blog posts, media appearances, podcast guesting. AI drafts content.

### Compliance: SEC/FINRA Advertising Rules
This is the dominant constraint for analyst marketing. ALL marketing content must comply:

**Prohibited:**
- Promises or guarantees of returns
- Cherry-picked performance data without full context
- Testimonials (with limited exceptions under new SEC rules)
- Misleading comparisons to benchmarks
- Claims about future performance

**Required:**
- Fair and balanced presentation of risks and rewards
- Performance shown net of fees
- Appropriate time periods (not just best-performing quarters)
- Material disclosures about strategy, risks, fees
- Compliance officer review before external distribution (at Levels 1-2)

**AI behavior:**
- Scan all marketing content against SEC/FINRA rules before sending
- Flag potential violations with specific rule citations
- At autonomy Level 1-2: queue for compliance officer review
- At autonomy Level 3-4: AI applies rules automatically, logs decisions
- Never distribute performance data without full disclosure context

### Fund Marketing
- Accredited investor targeting requirements
- Regulation D exemption advertising rules
- Form ADV disclosure requirements
- Private placement memorandum references

### Thought Leadership Content
The AI helps analysts publish regularly:
- Market commentary (weekly/monthly)
- Sector deep dives
- Deal case studies (with appropriate anonymization)
- Conference takeaways
- Original research summaries

### Key Metrics (analyst-specific):
- LP engagement rate (opens, clicks, responses)
- Inbound LP inquiry volume
- AUM growth attributable to marketing
- Conference ROI (connections made, follow-up conversion)
- Content engagement (views, shares, comments on LinkedIn)
- Media mention volume and sentiment

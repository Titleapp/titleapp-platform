# Investment Analyst — Onboarding Rules
# Extends: raas/onboarding/business-onboarding.md

## Analyst-Specific Onboarding Steps

### Data Import Priorities (in order of value):
1. **Portfolio/watchlist** — Active investments, positions, or deals being tracked. This is what the analyst works on daily.
2. **Client/LP list** — Limited partners, investors, or clients. Names, contact info, investment amounts, communication preferences.
3. **Research documents** — Existing memos, models, presentations. The AI learns the analyst's style and frameworks.
4. **Market data preferences** — Which sectors, geographies, asset classes to monitor.

### First Value — Analyst Specific:
1. **Portfolio alert** — "Based on your watchlist, Company X reported earnings yesterday that beat estimates by 12%. Here's my quick analysis."
2. **Market briefing** — "Here's your morning brief: 3 portfolio companies have news, 2 sector trends to watch, 1 macro event that affects your thesis."
3. **Research gap** — "You're tracking 15 companies but haven't updated your model on 3 of them in over 30 days."

### Team Roles (analyst-specific):
- Senior Analyst
- Junior Analyst
- Portfolio Manager
- Research Associate
- Compliance Officer
- Operations / Back Office
- Investor Relations

### Key Onboarding Question (analyst-specific):
"What's your investment focus?" — Sector (tech, healthcare, energy), strategy (long/short, value, growth), geography, asset class. This configures the AI's research and monitoring priorities.

### Compliance Note:
During onboarding, if the analyst indicates they work at a registered investment advisor (RIA) or broker-dealer, flag that SEC/FINRA advertising and communication rules apply. These affect what the AI can draft and send externally.

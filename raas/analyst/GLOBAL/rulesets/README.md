# Analyst Rulesets — GLOBAL

Rulesets define deterministic screening logic for each Analyst domain.

They are intentionally conservative:
- if required inputs/docs are missing, the workflow must request them
- numeric claims must follow evidence-first SOPs
- tenant risk profile gates the outcome

These are v0 baseline rulesets used by the Analyst workflows catalog.

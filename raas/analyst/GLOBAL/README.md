# RAAS — Analyst — GLOBAL

This is the GLOBAL (non-jurisdiction-specific) RAAS package
for the Analyst vertical.

It contains:
- workflow definitions
- onboarding question sets
- SOPs (guardrails)
- output templates
- domain rulesets

Future jurisdictional or tenant overlays
will extend this package without modifying it.

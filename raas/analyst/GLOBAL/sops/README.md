# Analyst SOPs — GLOBAL

This folder contains deterministic Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
used by Analyst workflows.

SOPs define:
- what claims are allowed
- how evidence must be cited
- how risk profiles are enforced
- when analysis must halt

If a rule is defined here, it is enforceable.
If a rule is not defined here, it is not assumed.

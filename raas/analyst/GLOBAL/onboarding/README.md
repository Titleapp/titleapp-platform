# Analyst — Onboarding (GLOBAL)

This folder contains machine-consumable question sets used to initialize a tenant
so Analyst workflows can run deterministically.

Onboarding captures:
- what “good” means (risk/return profile)
- how data is sourced (tenant subscriptions vs add-ons)
- whether a tenant model exists (Excel upload)
- optional benchmark anchoring (approved deal packets)

These JSON files are referenced by the Analyst vertical and may be overridden by tenant overlays.

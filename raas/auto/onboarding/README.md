# Auto Dealer — Onboarding Rules
# Extends: raas/onboarding/business-onboarding.md

## Auto-Specific Onboarding Steps

### Data Import Priorities (in order of value):
1. **Inventory file** — This is the #1 priority. Without inventory, the AI can't identify aging units, match customers to vehicles, or create marketing campaigns. Accept any format: DMS export, Excel spreadsheet, even a PDF printout from the lot management system.
2. **Customer list** — Enables lease expiration outreach, service-to-sales matching, and personalized campaigns. At minimum: name, phone, email, vehicle owned, purchase date.
3. **Service schedule** — Enables upsell identification and service-to-sales conversion. Upcoming appointments with customer name, vehicle, service type.
4. **F&I products and rate sheets** — Enables accurate payment quoting and F&I product recommendations. Carrier names, product names, pricing tiers.

### DMS Integration (future):
- CDK Global (formerly ADP Dealer Services)
- Reynolds & Reynolds
- DealerTrack (Cox Automotive)
- DealerSocket
- When available, AI should offer DMS connection as the preferred import method.

### First Value — Auto Specific:
The most impactful first insights for auto dealers are:
1. **Aging inventory** — floor plan interest costs real money every day. Flagging units over 60/90 days is immediately actionable.
2. **Lease expirations** — customers whose leases expire in 30-90 days are the hottest leads in the database.
3. **Service upsells** — tomorrow's service appointments with warranty/protection product opportunities.

### Team Roles (auto-specific):
- Sales Representative
- Sales Manager
- Finance Manager (F&I)
- Service Advisor
- Service Manager
- Parts Manager
- General Manager
- BDC Representative (Business Development Center)
- Internet Sales Manager
- Receptionist

### Key Onboarding Question (auto-specific):
"What brands do you carry?" — This loads the correct OEM co-op rules (Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, Stellantis, Hyundai/Kia, etc.) and state-specific advertising disclosure requirements.

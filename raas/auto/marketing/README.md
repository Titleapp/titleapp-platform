# Auto Dealer — Marketing Rules
# Extends: raas/marketing/README.md

## Auto-Specific Marketing

### Primary Channels (by priority):
1. **Google Ads** — Search intent is king for auto. "2025 Camry near me" is a buyer ready to act.
2. **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** — Inventory feeds, retargeting, conquest campaigns, lease expiration targeting.
3. **Third-party listing sites** — AutoTrader, Cars.com, CarGurus, TrueCar, Edmunds. These are where buyers shop.
4. **Google Business Profile** — Free, high-ROI. Reviews, posts, inventory updates.
5. **Direct outbound (email/SMS)** — Lease expirations, service reminders, conquest offers.
6. **Traditional** — Radio, TV, billboards, direct mail. AI drafts and tracks, human places.

### OEM Co-op Programs
This is the auto dealer's secret weapon. Manufacturers provide co-op advertising funds with strict compliance rules.

**How it works:**
- OEM allocates quarterly funds per dealer (e.g., Toyota: ~$15K/quarter for a mid-size dealer)
- Dealer creates ads that meet OEM creative requirements (logo placement, disclaimer text, approved imagery)
- Dealer runs ads on approved media channels
- Dealer submits proof-of-spend documentation to OEM
- OEM reimburses 50-100% of eligible spend

**AI's role in co-op:**
- Validate creative against OEM rules BEFORE launch
- Capture proof-of-placement during campaign
- Compile and submit reimbursement claims automatically
- Track fund balance and alert before expiration
- Flag use-it-or-lose-it deadlines

**OEM-specific rules (to be detailed in co-op-compliance.md):**
- Toyota / Lexus
- Honda / Acura
- Ford / Lincoln
- General Motors (Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac)
- Stellantis (Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram)
- Hyundai / Kia / Genesis
- Nissan / Infiniti
- Subaru
- Volkswagen / Audi
- BMW / Mini
- Mercedes-Benz

### Inventory-Linked Campaigns
The AI creates campaigns tied directly to inventory:
- **Aging units (60+ days):** Targeted price reduction campaigns, conquest offers to matching customer profiles
- **New arrivals:** Launch campaigns for hot models (allocations, limited editions)
- **Seasonal:** Convertibles in spring, 4WD/AWD in fall, truck season year-round in the South
- **Trade-in acquisition:** "We'll buy your car" campaigns when used inventory is low

### State Advertising Disclosures
Vehicle advertising is regulated at the state level. The AI must include required disclaimers:
- California: specific price advertising rules, "plus government fees and taxes" language
- Florida: documentary stamp fee disclosures
- Texas: advertising price must include all dealer-installed accessories
- Illinois: specific rules about "internet price" vs "selling price"
- Every state has variations — Digital Worker rules loaded by jurisdiction selection

### Key Metrics (auto-specific):
- Cost per sold unit (by source)
- Lead-to-sale conversion rate (by source)
- Speed-to-contact (time from lead to first response)
- Cost per lead (by channel)
- Co-op reimbursement rate (% of eligible spend recovered)
- Inventory turn rate (correlated with marketing spend)
- Service absorption rate (marketing's contribution to service revenue)

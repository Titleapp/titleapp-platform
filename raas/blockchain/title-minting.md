# Blockchain Title Minting — Venly / Polygon

See the main RAAS README for the blockchain provenance architecture.

Implementation: Phase 1 uses Firestore stubs with mock tx hashes.
Phase 2 wires up actual Venly API calls for on-chain minting on Polygon.

Provider: Venly (existing integration)
Chain: Polygon
Cost: ~$0.001 per mint (absorbed by TitleApp)

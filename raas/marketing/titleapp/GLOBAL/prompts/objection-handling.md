# Objection Handling — TitleApp Sales

## Overview

This document provides **evidence-based responses** to common objections.

**Framework:**
1. **Empathize** — acknowledge their concern
2. **Evidence** — provide proof, not just claims
3. **Alternative** — offer a low-risk path forward (trial, demo, guarantee)

---

## Pricing Objections

### "How much does this cost?" {#pricing}

**Response:**
> "For personal use, it's **$9/month** — less than a Netflix subscription. But instead of entertainment, this protects your $30,000 car, your $500,000 home, or your professional credentials.
>
> We also offer a **14-day free trial** (no credit card required) and a **30-day money-back guarantee**. So you can try it risk-free and decide if it's worth $9 to never lose your important records again."

**Inline action:** Show pricing comparison (TitleApp vs. cost of lost documents)

---

### "That's too expensive" {#too_expensive}

**Response:**
> "I get it. Let me put it in perspective:
>
> - Replacing a lost car title: **$50-150** (and weeks of hassle)
> - Missing service records when selling: **$500-2,000** in lost resale value
> - Can't prove ownership in a legal dispute: **Thousands in legal fees**
>
> TitleApp costs **$9/month** to prevent all of that. It's insurance for your proof.
>
> Plus, we have a **30-day money-back guarantee**. If you don't see the value, we'll refund you — no questions asked."

**Alternative:** "Want to start with the free trial and decide after you've used it?"

---

## Security & Trust Objections

### "How do I know my data is safe?" {#data_security}

**Response:**
> "Great question — security is our #1 priority. Here's how we protect your data:
>
> 1. **Blockchain-backed proof** — Your DTC is anchored to a public blockchain. Even if TitleApp disappeared tomorrow, your proof still exists.
> 2. **Encrypted storage** — All documents are encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256, same as banks).
> 3. **You own your data** — Unlike Carfax or other services, you can export your records anytime. No lock-in.
> 4. **Access control** — You decide who sees what. Share access with one click, revoke it anytime.
>
> We're also SOC 2 compliant (in progress) and have zero data breaches since launch."

**Inline action:** Show encryption badge + blockchain verification proof

**Alternative:** "Want me to walk you through our security architecture in more detail?"

---

### "What if I lose access to my account?" {#account_access}

**Response:**
> "Your DTC is **blockchain-backed**, which means it exists independently of your TitleApp account. Even if you lost your password or we went out of business, your proof is still there.
>
> Plus, we support **data export** — you can download all your DTCs and documents anytime. You're never locked in."

**Evidence:** Show example of blockchain verification URL (public, immutable record)

---

## Competitive Objections

### "How is this different from Google Drive?" {#vs_google_drive}

**Response:**
> "Good question! Google Drive is just file storage. TitleApp is a **verified, permanent record system**.
>
> Here's the difference:
>
> | Feature | TitleApp | Google Drive |
> |---------|----------|--------------|
> | **Blockchain verification** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
> | **Proof of authenticity** | ✅ Immutable | ❌ Files can be edited |
> | **Lifetime access** | ✅ Forever | ❌ Account-dependent |
> | **Structured records** | ✅ DTCs with metadata | ❌ Just folders |
> | **Shareability** | ✅ One-click sharing | ⚠️ Requires Drive access |
>
> Think of Drive as a **file cabinet**. TitleApp is a **notarized, permanent ledger**."

---

### "How is this different from Carfax?" {#vs_carfax}

**Response:**
> "Carfax only shows what dealers and shops report — and **you don't own that record**. It's Carfax's data, not yours.
>
> TitleApp is **your** record:
> - ✅ You control it
> - ✅ You can add service records Carfax doesn't have (oil changes, tire rotations, custom work)
> - ✅ It covers **any asset**, not just cars (home, credentials, investments, etc.)
> - ✅ Blockchain-backed proof that Carfax can't provide
>
> Plus, Carfax charges $40 for a single report. TitleApp is $9/month for unlimited DTCs."

---

### "I already use [competitor]" {#current_solution}

**Response:**
> "Got it! What are you using now?"
>
> [Customer names competitor]
>
> "Nice! How's that working for you — is there anything you wish it did better?"
>
> [Listen for pain points, then...]
>
> "Here's where TitleApp is different:
> - [Address specific competitor gap]
> - [Show inline demo of TitleApp's approach]
>
> Want to try both side-by-side for 14 days (free trial) and see which one you prefer?"

---

## Hesitation Objections

### "I need to think about it" {#hesitation}

**Response:**
> "Totally fair! No pressure. What would help you decide?
>
> Options:
> 1. **Start a free trial** — try it for 14 days, no credit card required
> 2. **See a live demo** — I can walk you through how it works for your specific use case
> 3. **Email summary** — I'll send you a recap with pricing, features, and next steps
>
> Which sounds best?"

**Alternative:** "Is there a specific concern I can address, or do you just need time?"

---

### "I'll sign up later" {#procrastination}

**Response:**
> "No worries! Just a heads-up — **most people sign up when they need their records and can't find them** (selling a car, insurance claim, legal issue). By then, it's too late to create the record.
>
> TitleApp takes 90 seconds to set up. Want to knock it out now so your proof is ready when you need it?"

**Alternative:** "I can email you a reminder link if that's easier?"

---

## Feature Objections

### "I don't need blockchain / don't understand blockchain" {#blockchain_confusion}

**Response:**
> "You don't need to understand blockchain any more than you need to understand how HTTPS works when you shop online.
>
> All you need to know:
> - ✅ Your DTC is **permanently provable** — no one can fake it or delete it
> - ✅ Even if TitleApp disappeared, your proof still exists
> - ✅ It's like a **digital notary stamp** that lasts forever
>
> That's it. We handle the technical stuff."

**Inline action:** Don't show blockchain jargon — just show "✓ Verified" badge

---

### "I don't have that many assets to track" {#not_enough_assets}

**Response:**
> "Fair! But here's the thing — you probably have more than you think:
>
> - Car title + service history
> - Home purchase documents
> - Student transcripts / degrees
> - Pet vaccination records
> - Pilot license / professional credentials
> - Investment records
>
> Even if you only protect **one thing** (like your car), $9/month is cheaper than replacing a lost title or missing service records when you sell.
>
> Plus, the first 14 days are free — so you can see if it's useful before committing."

---

## Enterprise / B2B Objections

### "We need to talk to our team first" {#team_decision}

**Response:**
> "Totally get it. What's the decision-making process look like?
>
> I can:
> 1. **Send a summary deck** — features, pricing, ROI
> 2. **Set up a team demo** — 30 minutes, walkthrough for your whole team
> 3. **Start a pilot** — test with 5-10 users, see if it works before committing
>
> Which would be most helpful?"

---

### "What's the ROI for our business?" {#roi}

**Response:**
> "Great question. Here's what our customers see:
>
> **Auto Dealers:**
> - $300/month → **$15,000+ in additional sales** (better trade-in transparency, faster closings)
> - ROI: **50:1**
>
> **Real Estate Agents:**
> - $9/month → **Close 1-2 extra deals per year** (faster document prep, better buyer confidence)
> - ROI: **100:1+**
>
> **Investment Analysts:**
> - $99/month → **Avoid 1 bad deal per year** (evidence-first screening catches red flags early)
> - ROI: **10,000:1+**
>
> We also offer a **90-day pilot with full refund** if you don't see ROI. Want to try it?"

---

## Legal / Compliance Objections

### "Is this legally binding?" {#legal_binding}

**Response:**
> "TitleApp creates a **verified record**, not a legal contract. Think of it like a notarized document — it's evidence, but you'd still use it in conjunction with your legal agreements.
>
> For things like **car titles** or **home deeds**, TitleApp is a backup proof system — the legal title still lives with the DMV or county recorder. But if those records get lost or disputed, your TitleApp DTC is permanent evidence.
>
> We're also working on integrations with legal systems (e-filing, court admissibility) — but that's future roadmap."

---

## Miscellaneous Objections

### "I don't trust AI / automation" {#ai_distrust}

**Response:**
> "I respect that. Here's the thing — TitleApp AI **doesn't make decisions for you**. It's just a helper:
>
> - AI suggests what to track (e.g., 'You should add your service records')
> - **You** decide what to upload and share
> - AI organizes your documents — **you** own the records
>
> Think of it like autocomplete — helpful, but you're always in control."

---

### "What if TitleApp goes out of business?" {#company_longevity}

**Response:**
> "Great question! Two safeguards:
>
> 1. **Blockchain backup** — Your DTC is anchored to a public blockchain. Even if TitleApp disappeared tomorrow, your proof still exists at that blockchain address.
> 2. **Data export** — You can download all your DTCs and documents anytime. No lock-in.
>
> You're not dependent on us to access your records — they're **yours forever**."

---

## Escalation

**When to escalate:**
- Customer explicitly asks for a human
- Stuck on an objection after 3 attempts
- Technical issue beyond AI scope
- Enterprise deal requiring custom terms

**How to escalate:**
> "Let me connect you with our team — they can walk through this with you personally."
> [Provide Calendly link or email: sales@titleapp.ai]

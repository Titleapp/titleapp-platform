## 11 Design Principles

### 1. Stupidly Easy for Agents
Voice-first, chat is primary interface, AI decides and asks for approval, morning briefing tells them what to do, zero cognitive load. The agent should never wonder "what should I do next?" — the AI tells them.

### 2. AI is the Consumer's Advocate
Consumer-facing communications are data-driven, not salesy. Agent's name in signature but AI leads with relevance and math. When a buyer asks "is this a good deal?" the AI shows comps, not cheerleading.

### 3. Visual Everything
Property maps with color-coded pins, CMA as map not spreadsheet, transaction timelines as visual progress bars, risk overlays (flood/fire/crime), portfolio heat maps by occupancy and revenue, commission pipeline as visual funnel.

### 4. AI as Buffer in PM
De-escalates tenant-landlord hostility. Validates feelings, states facts, sets expectations, follows up. Warns both sides before they do something illegal. "I understand you're frustrated about the noise. I've documented your complaint and notified the tenant in Unit 3B. Here's what happens next..."

### 5. Behavioral Tenant Screening
Communication patterns, responsiveness, previous landlord references, application completeness. Separate from credit/income hard data. Consistently applied, documented, never touches protected classes. "This applicant responded to every communication within 2 hours and provided all documents before being asked."

### 6. Seamless Payments
Autopay, one-tap, split rent between roommates, instant receipts, friendly late reminders not threats. "Your rent of $1,450 is due in 3 days. Tap here to pay now." Not: "FINAL NOTICE: PAY OR FACE EVICTION."

### 7. Education as Feature
AI teaches tenants their rights, agents what they should know, owners about their investment. "Did you know? In Florida, your landlord must return your security deposit within 15 days if there are no deductions." Knowledge reduces conflict.

### 8. Data-Driven Not Relationship-Driven
Real estate is a financial decision, not a friendship. The AI presents data: comps, trends, ROI projections, risk factors. Relationships matter for trust, but decisions should be grounded in numbers.

### 9. Owner Management Through Radical Transparency
No fake promises, just the math. When the original agent overpromised ("I'll get $1,800/month for this unit"), AI repositions to reality with comps and data, not finger-pointing. "Based on 12 comparable rentals within 1 mile, market rent for this unit is $1,550-1,625. Here's the data."

### 10. LTR / STR / Commercial Are Different Businesses
Workspace configures based on property types:
- **Long-term rental:** tenant lifecycle, NOI, lease management, maintenance operations
- **Short-term rental:** dynamic pricing, RevPAR, guest messaging, review management, channel sync (Airbnb/VRBO/Booking.com), cleaning coordination, supply management
- **Commercial:** lease abstracting, CAM reconciliation, tenant credit monitoring, NNN vs gross vs modified gross, TI allowances

### 11. Trust is the Product
AI has no commission, no agenda, no reason to lie. Shows its work, admits uncertainty, flags conflicts of interest, protects unpopular truths. "I know you want $500,000 for this property. The data says $435,000-$455,000. Here's why, and here's what we can do about it."

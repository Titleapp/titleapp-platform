Purpose

This directory defines Rules as a Service (RAAS) for California real estate.

It governs how TitleApp handles residential, commercial, HOA, and rental/property-management workflows within California’s regulatory environment.

⚠️ Not legal advice.
TitleApp provides workflow structure and compliance guardrails, not legal conclusions.

Commercial real estate

HOA-governed properties

Event-sourced property lifecycle

Disclosure-explicit sequencing

Encumbrance-aware ownership representation

System-of-record compatibility (county, escrow, title, assessor)

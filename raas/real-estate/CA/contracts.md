## Standard Forms

California does NOT require promulgated forms (unlike TX), but the California Association of Realtors (CAR) forms are industry standard and used in the vast majority of transactions.

### Residential Purchase Agreement (RPA)
The main contract for residential sales. Key features:

**Contingency System:**
California uses a unique contingency removal process:
- Default contingency period: 17 days for investigation, appraisal, loan
- Buyer must ACTIVELY REMOVE contingencies (in writing) — they don't automatically expire
- If buyer doesn't remove contingencies by deadline: seller can issue "Notice to Buyer to Perform" (NBP) giving buyer 2 more days
- If buyer still doesn't remove: seller can cancel
- AI tracks contingency deadlines and removal status

**Key Contingencies:**
- Investigation contingency (inspections — 17 days default)
- Appraisal contingency (17 days default)
- Loan contingency (17 days default)
- Sale of buyer's property contingency (varies)
- Each must be actively removed via CR form (Contingency Removal)

**Escrow:**
- Neutral third-party escrow company handles the transaction (NOT the title company or attorneys directly, as in other states)
- Escrow holds: earnest money, documents, distributes funds
- Closing = recordation of deed with county recorder
- Escrow timeline: typically 30 days (competitive market) to 45 days (standard)

**Agency Disclosure:**
- Required before or at the time the buyer or seller signs the purchase agreement
- Must disclose: who represents whom (seller's agent, buyer's agent, dual agent)
- Dual agency: legal in CA but must be disclosed and consented to by both parties

### Other Key CAR Forms:
- Buyer Representation Agreement (now required post-NAR settlement)
- Counter Offer (CO)
- Addendum (ADM)
- Contingency Removal (CR)
- Notice to Buyer to Perform (NBP)
- Notice to Seller to Perform (NSP)

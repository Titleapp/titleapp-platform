## Property Taxes

### Proposition 13 (1978)
- Assessed value = purchase price at time of sale
- Annual increases limited to maximum 2% (regardless of market appreciation)
- When property SELLS: reassessed to current market value
- This means long-time owners pay dramatically less than recent buyers
- AI explains Prop 13 impact: "The current owner pays $3,200/year because they bought in 2005 for $400K. At your purchase price of $850K, your taxes will be approximately $10,200/year."

### Tax Rate
- Approximately 1.1-1.4% of assessed value (base rate + special assessments)
- Varies by county and special districts
- Mello-Roos: special tax districts (common in newer developments) can add 0.5-1.5%
- AI calculates: base property tax + Mello-Roos + special assessments = total annual tax

### Supplemental Property Tax
- When property is reassessed (sale or new construction): supplemental tax bill issued
- Covers the difference between old and new assessed value for the remainder of the fiscal year
- Often a surprise for new buyers — can be thousands of dollars
- AI warns buyers about supplemental tax at closing

### Proposition 19 (2020)
- Allows homeowners 55+ or disabled to transfer their Prop 13 tax base anywhere in California
- Allows inherited homes to keep parent's tax base only if used as primary residence
- Previously: inherited homes kept low tax base even if used as rental
- Affects property management: inherited rental properties now get reassessed
- AI flags: estate properties for potential reassessment

## Transfer Taxes

### State Transfer Tax
- $1.10 per $1,000 of value (all CA counties)

### County Transfer Tax
- Varies by county
- Most counties: $1.10 per $1,000 (total with state: $2.20 per $1,000)
- Some cities have additional transfer taxes:
  - San Francisco: tiered, up to $7.50 per $1,000 (over $25M: even higher — "mansion tax")
  - Los Angeles: "Measure ULA" — 4% on sales $5M-$10M, 5.5% on sales over $10M
  - Oakland: additional city transfer tax
  - Berkeley: additional city transfer tax
- AI calculates exact transfer tax based on property location and sale price

### Who Pays
- Traditionally in CA: split 50/50 between buyer and seller
- Negotiable in every transaction
- AI defaults to local custom, flags for confirmation

## Insurance

### Homeowner's Insurance
- Required by lenders
- California insurance market is in CRISIS:
  - State Farm, Allstate, and other major insurers have stopped writing new policies in many areas
  - FAIR Plan (insurer of last resort) enrollment has surged
  - Premiums have increased 30-100%+ in fire-prone areas
  - AI flags: "This property is in a fire hazard zone. Insurance availability and cost should be verified before removing contingencies."

### Fire Insurance
- Critical in California
- Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones (VHFHSZ): insurance may be extremely difficult to obtain
- Defensible space requirements: 100 feet of clearance around structure
- AI checks: fire hazard zone status, alerts buyer to insurance challenges

### Earthquake Insurance
- NOT included in standard homeowner's policy
- Optional through California Earthquake Authority (CEA) or private insurers
- Expensive: typically $2,000-$5,000/year with high deductible (15%)
- AI informs: "Standard homeowner's insurance does NOT cover earthquake damage. The California Earthquake Authority offers supplemental coverage."

### Flood Insurance
- Required in FEMA Special Flood Hazard Areas
- Many CA areas are flood-prone (atmospheric rivers)
- AI checks FEMA flood zone

## CRITICAL: California has the STRONGEST tenant protections in the US.

The AI must be extremely careful about California landlord-tenant law. Violations carry severe penalties.

## Rent Control — AB 1482 (Tenant Protection Act of 2019)

### Statewide Rent Cap
- Applies to most residential rental properties in California
- Annual rent increase limited to: 5% + local CPI, OR 10%, whichever is LESS
- Effective through January 1, 2030

### Exemptions from AB 1482
- Properties built within the last 15 years
- Single-family homes (if owner is not a REIT or corporation AND proper notice given)
- Duplexes where owner occupies one unit
- Properties already subject to more restrictive local rent control
- AI checks: is this property subject to AB 1482? If exempt, what notice was given?

### Local Rent Control (may be MORE restrictive)
- San Francisco: very strict, rent increases tied to CPI only (~2-3%)
- Los Angeles (RSO): similar, tied to CPI
- Oakland: similar
- San Jose, Berkeley, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, and others
- AI must check both state AND local rent control
- AI loads city-specific rent control rules based on property location

### Just Cause Eviction (AB 1482)
Cannot evict without "just cause" after 12 months of tenancy:

**At-fault causes:**
- Non-payment of rent
- Breach of lease
- Nuisance or waste
- Criminal activity
- Refusal to sign renewal on same terms
- Refusal to allow lawful entry
- Subletting without permission

**No-fault causes (require relocation assistance):**
- Owner move-in (owner or immediate family)
- Demolition or substantial remodel
- Withdrawal from rental market (Ellis Act)
- Government order to vacate
- Relocation assistance: 1 month rent OR waiver of final month's rent

## Security Deposits

### Limits (California Civil Code 1950.5)
- Unfurnished: maximum 1 month's rent (effective July 1, 2024 — reduced from 2 months)
- Furnished: maximum 1 month's rent (reduced from 3 months)
- This is a SIGNIFICANT change — AI must apply current limits

### Return of Deposit
- **21 days** from move-out
- Written itemized statement of deductions
- Receipts or estimates for all deductions
- If repairs take longer: may provide estimate within 21 days, then actual costs within 14 days after completion
- Penalties for wrongful withholding: up to 2x deposit amount in bad faith

### Allowable Deductions
- Unpaid rent
- Cleaning to restore to move-in condition (beyond normal wear and tear)
- Repair of damage beyond normal wear and tear
- Cost to restore personal property if lease allows
- NOT: normal wear and tear, painting (unless excessive), carpet replacement (if past useful life)

## Eviction Process

### Notice Requirements
- **3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit** — non-payment
- **3-Day Notice to Cure or Quit** — curable lease violation
- **3-Day Notice to Quit** — incurable breach (nuisance, illegal activity, subletting)
- **30-Day Notice** — month-to-month, less than 1 year tenancy (no-fault, if exempt from just cause)
- **60-Day Notice** — month-to-month, more than 1 year tenancy (no-fault, if exempt from just cause)
- **90-Day Notice** — Section 8 tenants

### Process
1. Serve proper notice (personal service, substituted service, or posting)
2. Wait for notice period to expire
3. File Unlawful Detainer (UD) in Superior Court
4. Tenant has 5 days to respond
5. If no response: default judgment (5-10 days)
6. If contested: trial within 20 days of request
7. Judgment → Writ of Possession → Sheriff lockout (5 days after posting)
8. Total: 5-8 weeks typical, longer if contested

### COVID-19 Protections
- Various state and local protections have mostly expired
- Some local ordinances may still have lingering protections
- AI should check current status of local COVID rental protections

## Maintenance & Habitability

### Warranty of Habitability
California has one of the strongest implied warranty of habitability doctrines:
- Waterproofing and weather protection
- Plumbing, gas, and heating in good working order
- Hot and cold running water
- Sewage disposal
- Adequate heating
- Electrical lighting and wiring
- Clean and sanitary buildings and grounds
- Adequate trash receptacles
- Floors, stairways, railings maintained
- Locks on doors and windows
- Effective waterproofing
- Working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors

### Tenant Remedies for Habitability Violations
- Repair and deduct (up to 1 month's rent, twice in 12 months)
- Rent withholding (pay reduced rent based on diminished value)
- Lawsuit for damages
- Report to local code enforcement
- AI must respond immediately to any habitability complaint

### Landlord Entry (CA Civil Code 1954)
- **24 hours written notice** (reasonable notice presumed to be 24 hours)
- Between 8 AM and 5 PM, Monday-Friday (unless tenant consents otherwise)
- Allowed for: necessary repairs, agreed upon services, showing to prospective tenants/buyers, inspections
- Emergency: no notice required
- AI schedules all entries with proper 24-hour written notice

## Rent Payment
- Must accept at least one form of payment other than cash (unless tenant previously bounced a check)
- Cannot require electronic payment as the only option
- Must provide receipt if requested or if paying in cash
- Late fees must be "reasonable" — courts have generally upheld fees of 5-6% of monthly rent

## Source of Income Discrimination
- California law prohibits discrimination based on source of income
- Landlords MUST accept Section 8 / Housing Choice Vouchers
- Cannot refuse to rent to someone because their income includes: government assistance, SSI, SSDI, veterans benefits, child support, etc.
- AI NEVER screens out applicants based on source of income

## ADU (Accessory Dwelling Units)
- California has aggressive ADU laws enabling construction on single-family lots
- Affects property management: ADU creates a second rentable unit
- AI should know ADU rules for advising property owners on portfolio expansion

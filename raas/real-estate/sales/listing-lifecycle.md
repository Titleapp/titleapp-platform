# Path: raas/real-estate/sales/listing-lifecycle.md

## Stage 1: Listing Prospect
**Trigger:** Agent identifies potential seller (referral, expired listing, FSBO, sphere)

**AI actions:**
- Create contact record with type: seller, subtype: seller-prospect
- Research property: tax records, estimated value, last sale date, mortgage estimate
- Draft personalized outreach: "I noticed your home at 123 Oak St — the market in your neighborhood has appreciated 12% this year..."
- Prepare preliminary CMA before appointment

## Stage 2: Listing Appointment
**Trigger:** Appointment scheduled with potential seller

**AI actions:**
- Generate full CMA with comparable sales, active competition, market trends
- Prepare listing presentation materials
- Research seller's likely motivations (downsizing? relocating? divorce? estate?)
- Prep neighborhood statistics: avg DOM, list-to-sale ratio, inventory levels
- Send confirmation and pre-appointment package

## Stage 3: Listed (Pre-MLS)
**Trigger:** Listing agreement signed

**AI actions:**
- Input all property details
- Order photography, videography, virtual tour (or flag to agent)
- Draft MLS description
- Prepare all required disclosures per jurisdiction (load from FL/TX/CA rules)
- Schedule "Coming Soon" social media posts
- Determine pricing strategy: at market, slightly below (generate urgency), or above (test ceiling)

## Stage 4: Active on MLS
**Trigger:** Listing goes live

**AI actions:**
- Verify MLS syndication to Zillow, Realtor.com, Redfin, Trulia
- Launch marketing campaign: social media ads, email blast to buyer agents, targeted digital ads
- Schedule open house if appropriate
- Begin showing availability management
- Track views, saves, and inquiries on listing platforms
- Alert agent to every inquiry within 5 minutes

## Stage 5: Showings & Feedback
**Trigger:** Showing requests come in

**AI actions:**
- Coordinate showing times with seller
- Send showing confirmation to buyer's agent
- Follow up with buyer's agent within 2 hours of showing for feedback
- Aggregate feedback: "5 showings this week. 3 mentioned price seems high. 2 loved the backyard. 1 making an offer."
- Update seller weekly: showing count, feedback summary, market activity

## Stage 6: Offer Received
**Trigger:** Offer submitted by buyer's agent

**AI actions:**
- Alert agent immediately
- Analyze offer: price vs. list, earnest money, contingencies, closing timeline, buyer qualifications
- Calculate seller net proceeds (price minus commission, closing costs, mortgage payoff, repairs)
- Compare to asking price and recent comps
- If multiple offers: create comparison matrix
- Draft counter-offer recommendations if appropriate
- Track offer deadline

## Stage 7: Under Contract → Closing
See `transaction-management.md` for the full contract-to-close process.

## Stage 8: Post-Closing
**AI actions:**
- Send congratulations to seller
- Request review/testimonial (wait 7 days)
- Add to "past client" nurture campaign
- Schedule: 30-day check-in, home anniversary, birthday, holiday touchpoints
- Track: did the seller buy? Refer them to buyer's agent or handle internally
- Track: referral potential ("do you know anyone else thinking of selling?")

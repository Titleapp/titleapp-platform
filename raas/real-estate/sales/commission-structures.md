## How Commission Works

### Standard Residential
- Total commission: negotiable, typically 5-6% of sale price (post-NAR settlement: commission is fully negotiable and buyer's agent commission is no longer offered through MLS)
- Listing side: agent's commission per listing agreement
- Buyer side: per buyer representation agreement (required post-August 2024)
- Split between agent and brokerage per their agreement
- Example: $400,000 sale, 3% listing side, 2.5% buyer side
  - Listing agent: $12,000 gross, minus brokerage split
  - Buyer's agent: $10,000 gross, minus brokerage split

### NAR Settlement Impact (effective August 2024)
The AI must understand the post-settlement landscape:
- Buyer's agent compensation is NO LONGER offered through MLS
- Buyers must sign a buyer representation agreement BEFORE touring homes
- Buyer's agent commission is negotiated separately
- Sellers may still offer concessions that buyers can use toward agent compensation
- The AI should NEVER assume a specific commission structure — always ask

### Commercial
- Commission varies widely: 3-6% for sales, 4-8% of total lease value for leases
- Often negotiated per deal
- May include performance bonuses or tiered structures

### Property Management Fees
- Management fee: 8-12% of collected rent (NOT gross rent — only on what's actually collected)
- Leasing fee: 50-100% of first month's rent for placing a new tenant
- Lease renewal fee: $150-$500 or 25% of one month's rent
- Maintenance markup: 10-20% on vendor invoices
- Early termination fee: varies
- Eviction management fee: $200-$500 plus legal costs

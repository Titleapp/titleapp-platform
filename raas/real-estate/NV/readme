Purpose

This directory defines Rules as a Service (RAAS) for real estate workflows in Nevada.

It governs how TitleApp structures, sequences, and labels real-estate-related activities in Nevada across residential, commercial, HOA, and rental/property-management contexts.

⚠️ Not legal advice.
TitleApp provides workflow structure and compliance guardrails, not legal conclusions or representation.

Scope of Coverage

Nevada Real Estate RAAS applies to:

Residential property transactions

Commercial real estate transactions

HOA-governed properties and associations

Leasing, tenancy, and occupancy records

Encumbrances (liens, easements, CC&Rs)

Title-adjacent research and verification tasks

This package does not replace licensed professionals, brokers, property managers, or legal counsel.

Design Principles (Nevada-Specific)

Parcel-first identification
APN / parcel identifiers anchor property records; addresses are descriptive only.

Event-sourced lifecycle
Transfers, leases, HOA actions, management changes, and corrections are append-only events.

HOA-aware
HOA rules, assessments, and restrictions remain visible and must not be implied as resolved.

Rental & management continuity
Property management transitions must preserve historical tenancy and management records.

Encumbrance-aware
Liens, restrictions, and recorded interests remain attached until explicitly released.

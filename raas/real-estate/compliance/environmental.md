## Lead-Based Paint (Federal — applies everywhere)
- Homes built before 1978 may contain lead-based paint
- Federal law requires:
  - **Disclosure:** Seller/landlord must disclose known lead-based paint hazards
  - **Pamphlet:** Provide EPA pamphlet "Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home"
  - **Testing period:** Buyer gets 10 days to test (can be waived)
  - **Records:** Provide all available records of lead-based paint testing or removal
- AI auto-flags any property with year built before 1978 and includes lead paint disclosure in transaction checklist

## Asbestos
- Common in homes built before 1980: insulation, floor tiles, popcorn ceilings, pipe wrap
- No federal requirement to test or disclose for residential sales (state laws vary)
- Best practice: disclose if known
- Property management: if disturbed during renovation, EPA/OSHA regulations apply
- AI flags: "This property was built in 1972. Asbestos-containing materials may be present. Recommend disclosure and caution during any renovation."

## Mold
- No federal mold disclosure law (state laws vary — CA requires disclosure)
- Best practice: disclose if known
- Property management: respond to mold complaints promptly — habitability issue
- AI flags: any maintenance request mentioning "mold," "mildew," or "musty smell" gets elevated priority

## Flood Zones
- FEMA flood zone maps determine risk
- Mandatory flood insurance for properties in Special Flood Hazard Areas (Zone A, Zone V) with federally-backed mortgages
- Disclosure required in most states
- AI auto-checks FEMA flood zone for every property and includes in disclosures
- Property management: flood emergency plan for properties in flood zones

## Radon
- EPA recommends testing for all homes
- Some states require disclosure of known radon levels
- Mitigation systems are common and relatively inexpensive ($800-$1,500)
- AI includes radon in inspection recommendations

## Environmental Hazards (commercial)
- Phase I Environmental Site Assessment may be required
- Underground storage tanks, contaminated soil, hazardous waste
- AI flags commercial property transactions for environmental review

## Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act

RESPA governs the real estate settlement process and prohibits certain practices.

## Key Prohibitions

### Section 8: Kickbacks and Referral Fees
- PROHIBITED: Paying or receiving anything of value for referring settlement service business
- Settlement services: title insurance, mortgage, appraisal, home inspection, homeowner's insurance
- "Anything of value": cash, gifts, trips, marketing support, office space, leads
- AI MUST flag potential Section 8 violations:
  - "Title company is offering to pay for your client appreciation event" — VIOLATION
  - "Lender wants to give you leads in exchange for referrals" — VIOLATION
  - "Inspector offers 20% commission for each referral" — VIOLATION

### What IS Allowed:
- Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBA) with proper disclosure
- Cooperative marketing with shared cost (must be fair market value)
- Referral fees between real estate agents/brokers (not settlement services)
- Compensation for services actually performed

### Section 9: Seller Required Title Insurance
- Seller cannot require buyer to use a specific title insurance company
- AI should never draft contract language mandating a title company for the buyer

### Section 10: Escrow Accounts
- Limits on escrow account cushions
- Annual escrow analysis required

## AI Behavior
- Flag ALL arrangements between the agent and settlement service providers
- When recommending vendors (lenders, title companies, inspectors): provide at least 2-3 options
- If the agent has an affiliated business (owns a title company, etc.): ensure AfBA disclosure is provided
- Track referral relationships and ensure no prohibited compensation flows
- When drafting preferred vendor lists: include disclaimer that buyer/seller is free to choose any provider

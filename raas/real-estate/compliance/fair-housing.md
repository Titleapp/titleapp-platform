# Fair Housing Act Compliance

## THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPLIANCE DOCUMENT IN REAL ESTATE.

The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on:
1. **Race**
2. **Color**
3. **Religion**
4. **Sex** (includes sexual orientation and gender identity per 2021 HUD guidance)
5. **Handicap / Disability**
6. **Familial Status** (families with children under 18, pregnant women)
7. **National Origin**

Many states and cities add additional protected classes. See jurisdiction files.

## AI Rules — ABSOLUTE, NO EXCEPTIONS

### In Marketing:
- NEVER use language that indicates preference or exclusion based on protected classes
- NEVER: "perfect for young professionals" (familial status), "great for singles" (familial status), "close to [specific church]" (religion), "English-speaking neighborhood" (national origin)
- ALWAYS: describe the PROPERTY, not the ideal TENANT/BUYER
- OK: "2 bedroom condo, 1,200 sqft, updated kitchen, pool" — describes the property
- NOT OK: "ideal for a couple" — describes the person
- Meta and Google enforce "Special Ad Categories" for housing — restricted targeting, no age/gender/zip code targeting

### In Tenant Screening:
- Apply IDENTICAL criteria to every applicant
- Document the criteria: minimum credit score, income requirement, criminal background standards
- NEVER make exceptions for one applicant that aren't available to all
- NEVER consider protected class information in screening decisions
- Reasonable accommodations for disability MUST be considered (service animals, modifications)

### In Showings:
- NEVER steer buyers/tenants toward or away from neighborhoods based on protected classes
- Show all available properties that meet stated criteria regardless of neighborhood demographics
- NEVER volunteer demographic information about neighborhoods
- If asked about schools: provide factual data (ratings, distance), not subjective characterizations
- If asked about safety: "I recommend checking local crime statistics" — don't characterize neighborhoods

### In Communications:
- NEVER use discriminatory language even in internal notes
- AI scans all communications for potential Fair Housing violations before sending
- If a property owner says "I don't want to rent to [protected class]" — the AI REFUSES and explains Fair Housing law
- Document all Fair Housing concerns for compliance

### Exemptions (narrow):
- Owner-occupied buildings with 4 or fewer units (Mrs. Murphy exemption)
- Single-family homes sold/rented by owner without a broker (limited)
- Housing operated by religious organizations or private clubs (limited)
- Senior housing (55+ communities) — exempt from familial status only
- AI should NEVER assume an exemption applies. Default to full compliance.

### Penalties:
- HUD complaints → investigation → conciliation or administrative hearing
- Federal lawsuits with damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees
- Pattern/practice cases: DOJ involvement
- State enforcement varies but is often MORE aggressive
- Reputational damage: public records, media coverage
- THE AI NEVER RISKS A FAIR HOUSING VIOLATION. EVER.

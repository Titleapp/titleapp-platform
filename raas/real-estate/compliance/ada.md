## Fair Housing Act — Disability Provisions

### Reasonable Accommodations
- A change in rules, policies, or services to allow a person with a disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing
- Must be granted unless it creates an "undue financial or administrative burden"
- Examples: allowing a service animal in a no-pet building, providing a reserved parking space, allowing a live-in aide

### Reasonable Modifications
- Structural changes to the unit or common areas
- Tenant pays (in rental) unless federally funded
- Landlord must allow if reasonable
- Examples: grab bars, ramp, wider doorways, lowered countertops

### Service Animals vs. Emotional Support Animals
- Service animals: trained to perform specific tasks. Always allowed. No pet deposit.
- Emotional Support Animals: require documentation from healthcare provider. Allowed as reasonable accommodation. No pet deposit.
- AI NEVER questions the validity of a service animal. AI may request documentation for ESA per HUD guidelines but must handle sensitively.

### New Construction (post-1991)
- Buildings with 4+ units must meet accessibility requirements:
  - Accessible common areas
  - Doors wide enough for wheelchairs
  - Accessible route into and through the unit
  - Reinforced bathroom walls for grab bar installation
  - Accessible light switches, outlets, thermostats
  - Usable kitchens and bathrooms

## AI Behavior
- When a tenant or buyer requests an accommodation: GRANT IT or escalate to manager. Never deny without legal review.
- When listing properties: include accessibility information if known
- When marketing: never exclude people with disabilities
- When screening: NEVER consider disability status
- When handling maintenance: prioritize accessibility-related requests (broken ramp, malfunctioning elevator)

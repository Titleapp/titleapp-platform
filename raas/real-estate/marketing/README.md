## Overview

Real estate marketing operates at two levels:
1. **Property marketing** — selling or renting a specific property
2. **Agent/company marketing** — building the agent's brand and generating leads

Both are subject to Fair Housing Act restrictions on targeting and content.

## Fair Housing in Marketing — THE DOMINANT CONSTRAINT

### Meta (Facebook/Instagram) — Special Ad Categories
Since 2019, all housing-related ads on Meta must use the "Special Ad Category: Housing" designation. This restricts:
- NO age targeting
- NO gender targeting
- NO zip code targeting (minimum 15-mile radius)
- NO exclusion of any audience based on demographics
- NO lookalike audiences (must use "Special Ad Audiences")
- AI MUST set Special Ad Category on all housing-related Meta campaigns

### Google Ads — Housing Policy
- Similar restrictions to Meta
- Cannot target by age, gender, parental status, marital status, or zip code for housing ads
- AI must flag housing ad category

### MLS — Co-op Compensation Changes (post-NAR settlement)
- As of August 2024: buyer agent compensation is no longer displayed in MLS
- Marketing materials should not reference "commission included" or specific buyer agent compensation
- Buyer representation agreements are required before touring

## Channels by Use Case

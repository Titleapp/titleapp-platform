## Overview

Texas is the second-largest real estate market in the US. Key characteristics:
- No state income tax (major draw, like FL)
- TREC (Texas Real Estate Commission) heavily regulates contracts — promulgated forms are REQUIRED
- Property taxes are HIGH (1.6-2.5%+ of assessed value) — often surprises buyers from other states
- Unique "option period" system instead of traditional inspection contingency
- Title insurance rates are promulgated (state-set, non-negotiable)
- No state rent control (and state law prohibits local rent control)
- Landlord-friendly but with specific statutory requirements
- HOA regulation through Texas Property Code Chapter 209
- Diverse markets: Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, San Antonio all very different
- Community property state (affects title and divorce situations)

## Additional Protected Classes
Texas adds no additional state-level protected classes beyond federal Fair Housing.
Some cities add protections:
- Austin: sexual orientation, gender identity, source of income
- Dallas: sexual orientation, gender identity
- San Antonio: sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status
- Houston: currently no additional (proposed ordinances have been contested)

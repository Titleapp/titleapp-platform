## Seller's Disclosure Notice (TREC form)

Texas Property Code Section 5.008 REQUIRES sellers to provide a written Seller's Disclosure Notice. This is a statutory form — not optional.

### Required Disclosures
- Structural: foundation issues, roof leaks, water damage, past repairs
- Mechanical: HVAC, plumbing, electrical condition
- Water: source (municipal, well, MUD), water heater, septic system
- Environmental: flooding history, asbestos, lead paint, termites, radon
- Neighborhood: noise, odors, HOA, deed restrictions, lawsuits
- Insurance claims history
- Known defects: anything that materially affects property value

### Exemptions from Disclosure
- Foreclosure sales
- Court-ordered sales (estate, bankruptcy)
- Sales by government entities
- Sales between co-owners or family members
- New construction (builder warranty applies)
- AI checks: does this transaction require a seller's disclosure?

## MUD (Municipal Utility District) Disclosure
- Texas has THOUSANDS of MUDs
- MUD properties have additional property taxes to fund infrastructure
- Notice required at or before contract execution
- AI auto-checks: is the property in a MUD? If yes, generate MUD notice.

## PID (Public Improvement District) Disclosure
- Similar to MUD but for specific public improvements
- Additional assessments on property tax bill
- Buyer must be informed before contract

## HOA Disclosure
- TREC Addendum for Property Subject to Mandatory HOA Membership
- HOA resale certificate required (contains: dues, restrictions, financials, pending assessments)
- Buyer has right to terminate within specific period after receiving HOA documents

## Flood Disclosure
- No specific state statute requiring flood disclosure, BUT:
- Seller's Disclosure Notice asks about flooding
- Failure to disclose known flooding = fraud
- AI auto-checks FEMA flood zone

## Property Tax Disclosure
- Texas property taxes are among the highest in the US (no income tax, high property tax)
- Buyers from other states are often shocked
- AI calculates estimated annual property tax for every transaction
- Include in buyer cost analysis prominently

## Natural Hazard Disclosures
- Coastal area properties: erosion, hurricane risk
- Wildfire risk areas
- Agricultural or industrial neighbors

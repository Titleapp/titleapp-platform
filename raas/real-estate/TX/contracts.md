## CRITICAL: TREC Promulgated Forms

Texas is unique: TREC requires the use of promulgated (state-approved) contract forms. Agents CANNOT use custom contracts or modify promulgated forms except in specific blanks.

### Primary Residential Contracts
- **One to Four Family Residential Contract (Resale)** — most common
- **New Home Contract (Incomplete Construction)**
- **New Home Contract (Complete Construction)**
- **Unimproved Property Contract** — land
- **Farm and Ranch Contract**
- **Residential Condominium Contract**

### Key Texas Contract Features

**Option Period (unique to Texas):**
- Buyer pays a non-refundable option fee (typically $100-$500) for the right to terminate for ANY reason during the option period
- Option period: negotiated (typically 7-10 days)
- During option period: buyer conducts inspections, reviews property
- Buyer can terminate for ANY reason and only loses the option fee (earnest money is refunded)
- This replaces the traditional "inspection contingency" used in other states
- AI tracks option period deadline — this is the most time-sensitive deadline in a TX transaction

**Earnest Money:**
- Deposited within 3 days of effective date (standard)
- Held by title company
- Refundable during option period
- At risk after option period expires (unless another contingency applies)
- Typical amount: 1% of purchase price

**Title Commitment:**
- Seller provides title commitment within 20 days (standard)
- Buyer has objection period (varies)
- Title company issues commitment, buyer reviews for liens, easements, restrictions

**Survey:**
- Seller typically provides existing survey
- If no existing survey: negotiated who pays
- Buyer can object to survey findings during survey objection period

**Financing Contingency:**
- Third Party Financing Addendum attached if buyer is getting a loan
- Specifies: loan type, amount, interest rate, term
- If buyer can't obtain financing within specified terms: can terminate, earnest money refunded
- Track loan approval deadline

**Property Condition:**
- Seller's Disclosure Notice (required — see disclosures.md)
- "As-Is" provision available but seller still must disclose known defects
- Repair negotiations happen during option period

### Addenda (TREC Promulgated)
- Third Party Financing Addendum
- Loan Assumption Addendum
- Seller Financing Addendum
- Addendum for Property Subject to Mandatory Membership in HOA
- Addendum for Sale of Other Property by Buyer
- Addendum for "Back-Up" Contract
- Environmental Assessment, Threatened or Endangered Species and Wetlands Addendum
- Short Sale Addendum
- Addendum for Coastal Area Property

## AI Behavior with TX Contracts
- NEVER draft custom contract language — use TREC forms only
- Fill in the blanks per agent instructions
- Track ALL deadlines from effective date
- Option period deadline is #1 priority — missing it means buyer loses their "out"
- Flag: if no option fee paid, buyer has no unrestricted termination right

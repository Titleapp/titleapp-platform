## Security Deposits

### Holding Requirements
- No statutory requirement for separate account
- No requirement for interest
- No requirement to notify tenant of account location
- BUT: must return within 30 days of move-out

### Return of Deposit (TX Property Code 92.103)
- **30 days** after tenant moves out AND provides forwarding address
- Written itemized list of deductions
- If landlord fails to return or provide itemization within 30 days: presumed bad faith, tenant can recover 3x amount wrongfully withheld + $100 + attorney's fees
- AI auto-generates deposit return timeline and itemized statement

### Allowable Deductions
- Unpaid rent
- Damages beyond normal wear and tear
- Cleaning costs
- Costs of reletting (if tenant broke lease)
- NOT: normal wear and tear

## Rent & Late Fees

### Late Fees
- Must be "reasonable" (TX Property Code 92.019)
- Cannot charge late fee until rent is at least 1 full day late
- For a dwelling: late fee cannot exceed 10% of rent (reasonable standard)
- For manufactured home lots: 2 grace days required, cannot exceed 10%

### Non-Payment Process
1. Rent due per lease
2. After due date: late fee if specified in lease
3. **3-Day Notice to Vacate** (TX Property Code 24.005)
   - Written notice delivered in person, by mail, or posted on inside of main door
   - 3 days to vacate (can specify less in lease, but 1 day minimum)
   - Can be combined with demand for rent
   - AI generates compliant notice
4. File Forcible Detainer (eviction) in Justice Court
5. Court hearing within 10-21 days
6. If judgment for landlord: tenant has 5 days to appeal
7. If no appeal: Writ of Possession → constable executes

## Eviction Process

### Timeline (typical non-payment)
- Day 0: Rent due
- Day 1+: Late fee
- Day 1+: Serve 3-day notice to vacate
- Day 4+: File forcible detainer in Justice Court
- Day 14-25: Court hearing
- If judgment: 5 days for appeal
- If no appeal: Writ of Possession → 24-48 hours
- Total: approximately 3-5 weeks if uncontested

### Important TX Rules
- "Lock-out" is partially allowed: landlord CAN change locks for non-payment IF lease allows AND landlord provides 24-hour access to tenant's belongings (TX Property Code 92.0081) — BUT this is risky and not recommended
- AI should NEVER recommend lock-outs — always recommend formal eviction process
- Tenant can stay pending appeal by posting bond
- Retaliatory eviction protections exist (TX Property Code 92.331)

## Maintenance & Habitability

### Landlord Obligations (TX Property Code 92.052)
- Duty to repair or remedy condition that MATERIALLY affects health or safety
- Tenant must: be current on rent, give written notice, allow reasonable time to repair
- If landlord fails: tenant can file with Justice Court, deduct from rent (with court approval), or terminate lease
- "Reasonable time" depends on severity: emergency = immediately, non-emergency = 7 days is generally considered reasonable

### Specific Requirements
- Smoke detectors: required in every bedroom, landlord must install and maintain
- Door locks: deadbolt on every exterior door, peephole, sliding door pin/security bar
- Window locks: required on all exterior windows
- Landlord must re-key locks within 7 days of each turnover
- AI tracks: lock changes at every move-in/move-out

### Landlord Entry
- Texas has NO statutory notice requirement for landlord entry (unlike most states)
- Best practice: 24-hour notice (and include notice requirement in lease)
- AI defaults to 24-hour notice even though not legally required
- Emergency: no notice needed

## Lease Termination
- Fixed term: ends on specified date
- Month-to-month: either party gives 30 days' notice (unless lease specifies differently)
- Military: SCRA protections apply
- Family violence: victim can terminate with 30 days' notice + documentation (TX Property Code 92.016)
- AI flags: SCRA and family violence termination rights

## No Rent Control
- Texas Property Code 214.902 PROHIBITS local municipalities from imposing rent control
- Exception only for severe housing emergency declared by governor
- AI does not need to check for rent control ordinances in TX

## Stage 1: Prospect
**Trigger:** Inquiry on vacant unit

**AI actions:**
- Respond within 15 minutes (vacancy costs ~$50/day)
- Qualify: move-in date, budget, pets, number of occupants, reason for moving
- Schedule showing
- Pre-screen: income requirement (typically 3x rent), criminal/credit minimums
- If clearly unqualified: politely inform of requirements, suggest alternatives

## Stage 2: Applicant
**Trigger:** Application submitted

**AI actions:**
- Verify application completeness
- Order background check: credit, criminal, eviction history, employment verification, income verification, previous landlord reference
- Fair Housing compliance: SAME criteria for EVERY applicant. No exceptions. No discretion based on protected classes.
- Screening criteria must be documented, consistent, and applied equally
- Approval/denial within 48-72 hours
- If denied: provide adverse action notice per FCRA requirements
- If approved: generate lease, send for signatures

## Stage 3: Active Tenant
**Trigger:** Lease signed, moved in

**AI actions:**
- Monitor rent payments monthly
- Track maintenance requests
- Track lease compliance (noise complaints, unauthorized occupants, pet violations)
- Send lease renewal offer 90 days before expiration
- Annual property inspection (with proper notice per state law)
- Communication log for all interactions

## Stage 4: Renewal or Notice
**Trigger:** 90 days before lease expiration

**AI actions:**
- Analyze: payment history, maintenance frequency, complaints, market rent
- Generate renewal recommendation
- If renewing: new lease terms, rent adjustment
- If not renewing: begin vacancy prep and marketing
- If tenant gives notice: schedule move-out inspection, begin marketing

## Stage 5: Move-Out
**Trigger:** Notice given or lease expiration

**AI actions:**
- Schedule pre-move-out inspection
- Provide move-out instructions: cleaning requirements, key return, utility transfer
- After move-out: formal inspection with photos
- Security deposit disposition within state deadline:
  - FL: 15 days if full return, 30 days with itemized deductions
  - TX: 30 days
  - CA: 21 days
- Unit turn coordination: cleaning, paint, carpet, repairs
- Cost tracking: actual turn cost vs budget
- When turn complete: relist unit immediately

## Stage 6: Past Tenant
**AI actions:**
- Archive records (retain per state requirements)
- If good tenant: add to "preferred tenant" list for future vacancies
- If problem tenant: flag in system (factual documentation only, no discriminatory notes)

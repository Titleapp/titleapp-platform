## The Cost of Vacancy
Every day a unit sits vacant costs the owner money. For a $1,500/month unit, vacancy costs approximately $50/day. The AI's goal is to minimize vacancy days.

**Benchmark:** Market average varies but target is under 14 days from listing to lease signed.

## Vacancy Pipeline

### Pre-Vacancy (Before Move-Out)
- 90 days before lease end: Begin renewal process
- If tenant gives notice: begin marketing BEFORE move-out
- "Coming Soon" listings can start showing to prospects while unit is still occupied (with tenant cooperation and proper notice)
- Schedule unit turn vendors in advance so they can start the day after move-out

### Unit Turn
**Target: 3-5 days from move-out to listing-ready**

Turn checklist:
1. Move-out inspection (day of move-out)
2. Deep clean (day 1-2)
3. Paint touch-up or full repaint (day 1-3)
4. Carpet clean or replacement (day 2-3)
5. Maintenance repairs (day 1-3)
6. Final inspection (day 3-5)
7. Professional photos (day 4-5)
8. List immediately

AI manages turn by dispatching and tracking each step. If any step is delayed, AI escalates.

### Marketing Active Vacancy
**Tier 1 — Listing platforms (immediate):**
- Apartments.com / Rent.com
- Zillow Rentals
- Facebook Marketplace
- Realtor.com Rentals
- MLS (if available for rentals in market)
- Company website

**Tier 2 — Targeted (within 48 hours):**
- Social media posts (Facebook, Instagram)
- Google Business Profile post
- Email to waiting list / prospect database
- Yard sign at property

**Tier 3 — Enhanced (if needed after 14 days):**
- Facebook/Instagram ads targeted to area
- Google Ads for "apartments near [location]"
- Adjust pricing or offer concession

### Showing Management
- AI schedules showings, confirms with prospects
- Self-showing lockbox option (if available)
- Follow up within 2 hours of showing: "How did you like the unit? Ready to apply?"
- Track: showings per week, applications per showing, conversion rate

### Application → Approval → Lease
- Goal: application submitted within 24 hours of showing
- Screening completed within 48 hours
- Lease generated and sent same day as approval
- Move-in scheduled within 7 days of approval
- Total target: showing to signed lease in 5-7 days

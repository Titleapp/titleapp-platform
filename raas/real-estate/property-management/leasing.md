## Lease Types

### Fixed-Term
- Standard 12-month lease (most common)
- End date specified
- Early termination: per lease terms (typically 2 months penalty + 60 days notice)
- Converts to month-to-month at expiration if not renewed (configurable)

### Month-to-Month
- No fixed end date
- Either party can terminate with notice (typically 30 days, varies by state)
- Usually at premium rent (+5-10% over fixed-term)
- Common for: existing tenants post-lease, short-term situations, uncertain markets

### Corporate / Furnished
- Short-term (3-6 months) for business relocations
- Furnished units at premium pricing
- May include utilities

### Section 8 / Housing Choice Voucher
- Government-subsidized housing
- Tenant pays portion, Housing Authority pays remainder
- Annual inspections required
- Specific lease addenda required
- AI must track: inspection dates, HAP contract terms, rent reasonableness

### Student Housing
- Lease term matches academic year
- Individual leases or joint leases
- Guarantor/co-signer common
- Higher turnover, seasonal vacancy patterns

## Rent Pricing Strategy

### Market Analysis
AI analyzes to recommend rent:
- Comparable units in same area (within 0.5-1 mile radius)
- Same property type, similar beds/baths/sqft
- Adjust for: condition, amenities, age, floor level, view, parking
- Seasonal adjustment: summer is high season (more demand), winter is slower
- Data sources: Zillow Rental, Apartments.com, Rent.com, MLS rental listings

### Pricing Rules
- New listing: price at market or slightly below to minimize vacancy days
- Renewal: increase 3-5% annually (if below market), match market (if at market), hold (if above market or good tenant)
- Vacancy over 30 days: consider reducing price 3-5%
- Vacancy over 60 days: reduce price or offer concession (first month free, reduced deposit)
- NEVER price based on tenant characteristics (Fair Housing)

### Concessions
AI may recommend concessions to fill units faster:
- Move-in special: first month 50% off
- Reduced security deposit
- Free parking (if normally paid)
- Waived pet deposit
- Flexible move-in date
- Track: concession cost vs. vacancy cost (vacancy is almost always more expensive)

## Rent Increases
- Check local rent control laws FIRST (CA: AB 1482 limits most increases to 5% + CPI or 10%, whichever is less)
- TX and FL: no state rent control (but check local ordinances)
- Give proper notice per state law (FL: 30 days for MTM; TX: 30 days for MTM; CA: 30 days if under 10%, 90 days if 10%+)
- AI recommends increase amount based on market data, tenant history, and owner preference
- Present to owner for approval before sending to tenant

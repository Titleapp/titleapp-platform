## Security Deposits

### Holding Requirements (FL Statute 83.49)
Landlord must choose ONE of three methods:
1. Non-interest-bearing account in a Florida banking institution
2. Interest-bearing account (pay tenant interest or 5% simple interest annually, landlord's choice)
3. Post a surety bond with the county clerk for the total amount of deposits held

### Deposit Notice
Within 30 days of receiving deposit, landlord must notify tenant in writing:
- Name and address of banking institution
- Whether the account is interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing
- Rate of interest (if applicable)
- **FAILURE TO GIVE NOTICE = landlord forfeits right to claim against deposit**
- AI generates this notice automatically at lease signing

### Return of Deposit
- **Full return:** Within 15 days of move-out
- **With deductions:** Written notice by certified mail within 30 days of move-out
  - Must itemize each deduction with amount
  - Tenant has 15 days to object
  - If landlord fails to send notice within 30 days: forfeits right to claim against deposit
- **AI auto-generates** deposit return timeline and itemized statement

### Allowable Deductions
- Unpaid rent
- Damage beyond normal wear and tear
- Cleaning costs (if lease specifies)
- Early termination fees (if lease specifies)
- NOT: normal wear and tear, painting (unless excessive damage), carpet depreciation (age-appropriate)

## Rent & Late Fees

### Rent Due Date
- Per lease agreement (typically 1st of month)
- No statutory grace period (per lease only)
- Late fees must be specified in lease to be enforceable
- Late fees must be "reasonable" — courts vary but 5-10% is generally accepted

### Non-Payment Process
1. Day after rent is due: send friendly reminder
2. After grace period: assess late fee, send late notice
3. **3-Day Notice to Pay or Vacate** (FL Statute 83.56)
   - Must be delivered: hand delivery, posted on door, or mailed
   - 3 business days (excluding weekends, legal holidays)
   - Must state: exact amount owed, that tenant must pay or vacate
   - AI generates compliant 3-day notice
4. If tenant doesn't pay or vacate: file eviction (Complaint for Possession) in county court
5. Court process: typically 2-4 weeks if uncontested

## Eviction Process (Summary)

### Grounds for Eviction
1. **Non-payment of rent** — 3-day notice
2. **Lease violation** — 7-day notice to cure (for curable violations)
3. **Repeated violations** — 7-day unconditional notice (no cure if previously warned within 12 months)
4. **Holdover** — 15-day notice (month-to-month) or no additional notice (expired lease)

### Process
1. Proper notice served and expired
2. File complaint in county court
3. Tenant has 5 days to respond
4. If no response: motion for default judgment
5. If contested: hearing scheduled
6. Judgment → Writ of Possession → Sheriff executes (24 hours after posting)
7. Total timeline: 3-6 weeks typical (non-payment), longer if contested

### AI Rules for Eviction
- ALWAYS serve proper notice first
- NEVER attempt "self-help" eviction (changing locks, removing belongings, shutting off utilities)
- Track all notices with delivery method and dates
- Recommend attorney involvement for contested evictions
- Document everything
- Check for potential retaliatory eviction issues (tenant complained about habitability recently?)

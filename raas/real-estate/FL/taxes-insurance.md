## Property Taxes

### Homestead Exemption
- Primary residence gets up to $50,000 exemption from assessed value
- Must file with county appraiser by March 1
- Caps assessment increases at 3% annually (Save Our Homes amendment)
- AI reminds new homebuyers to file for homestead exemption immediately after closing
- WARNING: When selling a homesteaded property, the buyer will face a full reassessment — their taxes WILL be higher than the seller's

### Non-Homestead Properties
- Investment/rental properties: no homestead exemption
- Assessment increases capped at 10% annually
- Assessed closer to market value

### Tax Rates
- Vary by county (millage rates)
- Typically 1.0-2.0% of assessed value
- Include: county, city, school board, special districts
- 4% discount for paying in November (early payment discount)

### FIRPTA (Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act)
- If seller is a foreign person: buyer must withhold 15% of sale price for IRS
- Unless exemption applies (seller certifies US person, property under $300K and buyer will use as residence)
- AI auto-checks: "Is the seller a US person?" at listing intake
- If foreign seller: flag FIRPTA withholding requirement

## Transfer Taxes

### Documentary Stamp Tax
- On deed: $0.70 per $100 of consideration (except Miami-Dade: $0.60 per $100 + surtax of $0.45)
- On mortgage: $0.35 per $100 of mortgage amount
- Typically paid by seller (deed stamps) and buyer (mortgage stamps)
- AI calculates automatically based on county and transaction type

### Intangible Tax
- On new mortgages: $0.002 per $1 (0.2%) of mortgage amount
- One-time tax at recording
- Paid by buyer

## Title Insurance

### Florida Split
- In most of FL: seller pays for owner's title policy, buyer pays for lender's title policy
- In South FL (Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Sarasota, Collier): buyer pays for both
- This is CUSTOM, not law — negotiable in every transaction
- AI defaults to county custom, flags for confirmation

### Promulgated Rates
- Florida title insurance rates are set by the Office of Insurance Regulation
- Not negotiable (same rate from every title company)
- Based on purchase price
- Simultaneous issue discount for buyer getting both owner's and lender's policies

## Insurance

- Average premium: $3,000-$6,000+ (highest in the nation)
- AI flags: insurance affordability as part of buyer cost analysis

### Wind/Hurricane Insurance

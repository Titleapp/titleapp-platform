## Overview

Florida is one of the largest real estate markets in the US. Key characteristics:
- No state income tax (major draw for buyers and investors)
- Homestead exemption provides significant property tax protection
- Very active property management market (snowbirds, vacation rentals, investor-heavy)
- Documentary stamp tax instead of transfer tax
- Title insurance is split differently than most states
- Landlord-tenant law is relatively landlord-friendly
- Hurricane/wind insurance is a major factor
- Flood insurance required in many areas
- HOA and condo association laws are extensive (post-Surfside)

## Additional Protected Classes (beyond federal)
Florida adds NO additional protected classes at the state level, BUT many cities do:
- Miami-Dade: source of income, sexual orientation, gender identity
- Jacksonville: sexual orientation, gender identity
- Orlando: sexual orientation, gender identity
- Tampa: sexual orientation, gender identity
- AI loads city-level protections based on property location

## Johnson v. Davis (1985) — Florida's Disclosure Standard

Florida does NOT have a statutory seller disclosure form like most states. Instead, Florida follows the Johnson v. Davis case law standard:

**Sellers must disclose material facts known to them that:**
1. Are not readily observable by the buyer
2. Materially affect the value of the property

The AI should recommend that sellers complete a voluntary disclosure form even though it's not legally required — it provides documentation and reduces liability.

## Required Disclosures

### Radon Gas
- Florida statute 404.056(5) requires radon disclosure in every real estate transaction
- Standard language must be included in the contract
- AI auto-includes radon disclosure language

### Lead-Based Paint (federal)
- Required for homes built before 1978
- Disclosure form + EPA pamphlet + 10-day testing period
- AI auto-triggers for pre-1978 homes

### Property Tax Disclosure
- Buyer must be informed that property taxes may increase substantially after sale
- Homestead exemption may be lost and reassessment triggered
- AI includes property tax warning

### HOA / Community Association Disclosure
- If property is in an HOA or condo association:
  - Buyer has 3 days to rescind after receiving HOA documents (15 days for condos)
  - Association documents must be provided: declaration, bylaws, rules, budget, financials
  - Estoppel letter required for closing (confirms assessments, violations, reserves)
- Post-Surfside (2021): condo associations have new structural inspection and reserve requirements
- AI tracks: HOA doc delivery, rescission period, estoppel request

### Sinkhole
- Seller must disclose known sinkholes
- Florida has a specific sinkhole disclosure statute
- Insurance implications: sinkhole coverage is complex in FL

### Flood Zone
- Disclosure of FEMA flood zone status
- If in Special Flood Hazard Area: flood insurance required for federally-backed mortgage
- AI auto-checks FEMA flood zone

### Chinese Drywall
- Properties built/renovated 2001-2009 may have defective imported drywall
- Must disclose if known
- Insurance implications

### Coastal Construction Control Line
- Properties seaward of the CCCL have building restrictions

- Affects renovations and insurance

## AI Behavior
- For every FL listing, generate a disclosure checklist based on property characteristics
- Auto-include mandatory disclosures (radon, lead paint if applicable)
- Flag potential issues: age of home, flood zone, HOA, coastal location
- Recommend voluntary seller disclosure form completion
- Track: all disclosures delivered with timestamps and signatures

## Brokerage Models

### Solo Agent
- Single agent, possibly with an assistant
- Hangs license under a brokerage
- Commission split with brokerage (varies: 50/50 to 90/10 to 100% with desk fee)
- AI handles: everything a team would do — lead response, follow-up, transaction coordination, marketing

### Team
- Team leader + agents + possibly admin/TC
- Team leader usually takes a split from team members' deals
- AI handles: lead routing, team accountability, transaction tracking across all team deals

### Brokerage
- Broker owns the company, agents work under the brokerage
- Multiple commission models: traditional split, cap, flat fee
- AI handles: brokerage-wide reporting, agent performance, compliance oversight, recruiting support

### Property Management Company
- May be standalone or within a brokerage
- Portfolio of managed properties owned by different owners
- Revenue: management fee (8-12%), leasing fee (50-100% of first month), maintenance markup (10-20%), other fees
- AI handles: portfolio-wide operations, owner reporting, tenant management, vendor dispatch

### Hybrid (Sales + PM)
- Very common in FL and TX
- Agent sells homes AND manages rental properties
- Same workspace handles both pipelines
- AI understands context: "Maria called" — is she a buyer, seller, tenant, or owner? AI checks.

## Commission Structures

### Traditional Split
- Agent gets X%, brokerage gets Y%
- Common: 70/30, 80/20
- May improve with volume: "hit $100K GCI and go to 85/15"

### Cap Model
- Agent pays X% until they hit a cap ($20K-$25K typically)
- After cap, agent keeps 100% (minus transaction fee)
- Keller Williams, eXp, Real are cap models

### Flat Fee / 100%
- Agent pays flat monthly desk fee ($500-$2K) + per-transaction fee ($300-$500)
- Keeps 100% of commission
- HomeSmart, Fathom, NextHome

### Referral Fee
- 25% referral fee is standard for sending business to another agent
- Interstate referrals common
- AI tracks: who referred whom, fee owed, fee collected

### Team Splits
- Team leader typically takes 30-50% of team member's commission
- After brokerage split: if agent is 80/20 with brokerage and 60/40 with team leader, agent nets 48% of total commission
- AI calculates net commission automatically based on configured splits

## AI Behavior for Commission Tracking
- Track every deal's commission from listing/contract through closing
- Calculate net to agent after all splits
- Project monthly/quarterly/annual income based on pipeline
- Flag: "You need 2 more closings this quarter to hit your cap"
- Track referral fees owed and receivable

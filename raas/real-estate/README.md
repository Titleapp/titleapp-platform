Covered Domains

Residential real estate

Commercial real estate

HOA-governed properties

Rental properties and property management

Ownership transfers and recordation

Encumbrances and restrictions

Title-adjacent research and verification

Vertical Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Parcel-anchored records

Event-sourced lifecycle

Encumbrance visibility

HOA and governance transparency

Rental and management continuity

System-of-record deference

Relationship to Jurisdiction Packages

Jurisdiction packages:

Extend this baseline

Add mandatory disclosures and sequencing

May restrict actions but may not weaken baseline rules

Operating Rule

The absence of a jurisdiction-specific rule does not imply permission.
The system must surface uncertainty and defer rather than infer.

# 1. Product Philosophy

Title is not a dashboard app.

Title is a conversation-driven transaction engine.

Conversation → structured object → milestone transition → append-only record.

Chat is primary.  
Screens are secondary.

Door 2 (AI-native experience) is the main experience.  
Door 1 (traditional UI) is fallback visibility.

# 2. User Types

## A. Consumer (Vault User)

Wants:
- Protection
- Proof
- Simplicity
- Financial clarity

Does NOT want:
- Blockchain jargon
- CRM complexity
- Legal dashboard overwhelm

They want:
“I talked to AI and something real happened.”

---

## B. Dealer (Auto Client)

Wants:
- Increased revenue
- Reduced compliance risk
- Measurable conversion lift
- Control over messaging

Does NOT want:
- To babysit AI
- Loss of control
- Complicated workflows

---

# 3. Core UX Principle

Title hides a structured decision engine behind natural conversation.

AI advises.  
User approves.  
Objects become formal only after consent.

Nothing is shared without explicit approval.

---

# 4. Consumer Journey (Door 2 First)

### Step 1 – Landing

Chat-first homepage or GPT entry.

Opening tone:

“I help you protect and structure what matters most.  
What are we looking at today — a car, a home, something else?”

---

### Step 2 – Discovery

AI gathers:
- Asset details
- Intent
- Financial context

---

### Step 3 – Structured Insight

AI offers:

“I can structure this into a formal comparison so you can see the real numbers. Would you like me to do that?”

User says yes.

System creates:
- Trade Summary
- Valuation Snapshot
- Comparison Object

Rendered inside chat.

---

### Step 4 – Consent Layer

Before sharing:

“Nothing has been shared yet. Would you like to send this to the dealer?”

User must approve.

---

### Step 5 – Object Creation

System:
- Appends event
- Updates structured object
- Maintains version history

---

# 5. Dealer Journey (Auto AI Engine)

### Step 1 – Dealer Signup

- Account created
- Tenant auto-generated
- Auto RAAS template applied

---

### Step 2 – Data Upload

Dealer uploads:
- Service schedule
- Inventory
- Pricing

---

### Step 3 – AI Scoring

AI identifies upgrade opportunities.

Dealer approves outreach.

---

### Step 4 – Customer Chat

Customer enters GPT flow.

AI:
- Builds structured comparison
- Recommends optimal financial move

Customer approves sharing.

---

### Step 5 – Dealer Review

Dealer sees:
- Trade Summary
- Version history
- Offer changes

Changes append as new versions.

---

# 6. UX Requirements

1. Chat is primary.
2. Structured objects render inside chat.
3. Explicit consent before sharing.
4. Version history visible.
5. No blockchain terminology in UX.
6. Dealer retains approval control.
7. Consumer retains autonomy.

---

# 7. Door 1 vs Door 2

Door 2:
- GPT-native
- Conversational
- Structured objects inline

Door 1:
- Dashboard visibility
- Admin tools
- Record browsing

Door 1 supports Door 2.  
Door 2 leads.

---

# 8. Long-Term System Integrity

- Major actions append events.
- Canonical state derived from event log.
- RAAS enforces guardrails.
- AI remains advisory, not authoritative.
- Blockchain is infrastructure, not UX.

---

# 9. Execution Focus

Build Auto Revenue Engine first.

Short cycles.  
Measurable lift.  
Fast validation.

Vault evolves alongside.

---

Title is an AI-mediated transaction layer that:

- Structures decisions
